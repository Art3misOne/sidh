This software is an implementation of the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key
exchange invented in 2011 by DeFeo, Jao, and Plut. It is largely a Java translation of
Microsoft's C language implementation of SIDH except that the Java implementation is
object oriented.

The latest update to this code matches version 3 of Microsoft's C code. It incorporates
many optimizations and includes an additional parameter set.
