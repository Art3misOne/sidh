This upload is my implementation of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (sidh). I translated Microsoft's 
C implementation to Java. It's not a direct translation because I also made it object oriented. I'm working 
on Java code for RLWE and hope to post that soon. Then I will work on putting them into a clone of Signal.
